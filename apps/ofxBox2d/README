This is a simple wrapper for box2d using Openframeworks. The examples below are still in progressive, but should be stable for the most part. Please open up a issue if you have suggestions or find bugs. 

thanks,
Todd


Install:
The xcode projects have the box2d addon in ../addon/ofxBox2d. This is not your openframeworks add-on folder.
